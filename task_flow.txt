=> Task

2. Use Google App Engine(python), Git, NLP 
3.Below is high-level flow/journey for the bot implementation 
    3a. Welcome message from Restaurant_Name
    3b. Use your imagination on how you would request to book a table. (give a choice of available tables etc for e.g.)
    3c. The journey should be changed and customized if an old user is returning.
    3d. Keep in mind the confirmation steps on e-mail and the bot.
4. Use Google Datastore as your Database. 
5. Do not use any open source or paid NLP/bot building frameworks/platforms. All code should be customed developed by yourself.
